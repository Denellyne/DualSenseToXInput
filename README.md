## Regarding Virus Detections

If your device detect this as a virus beware it's a false positive,things like these happen all the time.

I've sent a sample to review to Microsoft and Malwarebytes and both of them confirmed its a false positive on the autoupdater ,in case of any problem just allow the file on your computer

[Malwarebytes Confirms its a false Positive](https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/307011-false-positive-on-my-autoupdater/)
